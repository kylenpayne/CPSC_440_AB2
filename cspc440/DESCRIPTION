Description: This is a package of various functions
    and data for teaching, learning, and doing various aspects of
    the course CPSC 440 in R. While much of the course is taught
    in SAS, it's only fair to present a set of utilities and
    functions for students and instructors that want to use R
    instead. This will also be a safe place to put cool little
    R examples that were used in the lab sections so that future
    TAs can use them for their benefit.
