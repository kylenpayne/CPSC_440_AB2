The home test kit market is offering faster and easier products that lend themselves to being used in less-sophisticated environments to meet consumers’ needs. A home blood sugar (glucose) test measures the level of glucose in your blood at the time of testing. The test can be done at home, or anywhere, using a small portable machine called a blood glucose meter. People who take insulin to control their diabetes may need to check their blood glucose level several times a day. Testing blood sugar at home is often called home blood sugar monitoring or self-testing.\n",
